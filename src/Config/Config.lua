-- Each class has its own file in this folder that decides how its Macro Spellbook page is organised.
-- Edit your class's file, then /reload. Every list is optional.
--
-- Use spell names exactly as the spellbook shows them. A name ending in * matches every spell that starts
-- with that text, e.g. "Create *" covers Create Healthstone (Minor), Create Soulstone (Major), ...
--
-- categories: the page's sections, top to bottom, each under its own header, as
--   { name = "Damage", spells = { "Shadow Bolt", ... } }. Move a section or a spell up or down to change
--   the order. A spell that matches more than one section goes in the first, so "Curse of Agony" listed
--   in Damage wins over a later section's "Curse of *". A section with no spells marks where custom
--   macros with that category go. Learned spells in no section go in an "Unsorted" section at the end,
--   in alphabetical order. Add noGlow = true to a section, e.g. { name = "Auras", noGlow = true, spells =
--   { ... } }, to stop its spells glowing when they aren't on your action bars.
--
-- mouseoverEnemy / mouseoverFriend: spells that offer "Cast On Mouseover" (right-click a macro), cast on a
--   hostile / friendly mouseover target. A spell in both lists casts on either. Every harmful spell with a
--   range (melee included) counts as a mouseoverEnemy spell without being listed, except cursor spells, so
--   mouseoverEnemy only needs the ones the game doesn't flag. Other spells in neither list never offer
--   it. The same spells offer "Cast On Focus": the page then also lists a second macro for the spell,
--   right after it, that casts on your focus target (or your target when you have no hostile / friendly
--   focus).
--
-- cursor: ground-targeted spells that offer "Cast At Cursor" (right-click a macro): the spell lands where
--   the cursor points, with no targeting circle to click.
--
-- raidRank1: spells that offer "Downrank In Raids" (right-click a macro): the macro casts the spell's rank 1
--   while you are in a raid group and its highest rank otherwise.
--
-- channeled: channelled spells that offer "Spammable" (right-click a macro): the cast gets a
--   [nochanneling:<spell>] condition, so pressing the macro again while the spell is channelling does
--   nothing and you can spam the button.
--
-- stealth: stealth spells that offer "Spammable" (right-click a macro): the cast gets a [nostealth]
--   condition, so pressing the macro again while stealthed doesn't take you out of stealth.
--
-- stances: spells that offer "Switch To <stance>" (right-click a macro), as
--   { ["Hamstring"] = { "Battle Stance", "Berserker Stance" }, ... }: the stances the spell can be cast in.
--   With it on, the macro first switches to the first listed stance when you're in none of them. A spell
--   whose tooltip says "Requires ... Stance" offers it too, with the stances the tooltip names (the list
--   then only picks which one to switch to), so the macros follow the game's rules. The stance
--   change and the spell can't always go off on the same press, so press the macro again if the spell
--   fails. Only Warriors use it.
--
-- petAbilities: summon spells that offer "Cast <ability> If Summoned" (right-click a macro), as
--   { ["Summon Imp"] = "Fire Shield", ... }. With it on, the macro casts the ability while that pet is out
--   and summons the pet otherwise. The pet is matched by its creature family: the name after "Summon ".
--   Only Hunters and Warlocks use it.
--
-- Pet attack is not set here: Hunters and Warlocks get it automatically. Every mouseoverEnemy spell then
--   offers "Enable Pet Attack" (right-click a macro): the macro starts with /petattack, sending your pet
--   at your target. The settings cog's "Enable Pet attacks before spell cast" turns it on for every such
--   macro you haven't switched yourself.
--
-- Stop casting, starting attack and using items aren't set here either: right-click a macro for its
--   "Before Casting" and "After Casting" menus, where you tick what the macro does on that side of the cast.
--   "Stop Casting", in the Before Casting menu only, adds /stopcasting to cancel your current cast. The settings cog's
--   "Stop casting before spell cast" turns on the before line for every spell macro you haven't switched
--   yourself. Warriors, Hunters and Rogues get "Start Attack" and "Start attack after spell cast" instead,
--   for /startattack (the cog's default is the after line). Druids, Paladins and Shamans, being hybrids,
--   get both.
--
--   Both menus also list your equipped items with a "Use:" effect, e.g. engineering gloves and trinkets.
--   Tick several to stack them: the macro uses each one, in the order you ticked them, on that side of the
--   cast. The macro uses the slot, not the item, so it keeps working when you swap a trinket.
--
--   Both menus also list your race's racials from smb.racials below, once learned, e.g. Blood Fury for
--   Orcs: ticked, the macro casts it on that side of the cast.
--
--   An Equipment section macro's right-click menu lists "Stop Attacking" and "Stop Casting" under a
--   "Before Using" heading: ticked, the macro starts with /stopattack or /stopcasting before using the item. They are per slot and
--   shared by every character, like the equipment macros themselves.
--
-- extraSpells: spell IDs to list with "Show Unlearned" on until learned, for spells that neither the
--   bundled trainer data (Data/) nor your class trainer offers, e.g. quest or book spells. Use the rank 1 ID
--   (the number in the spell's Wowhead URL).
--
-- custom: your own macros, as { name = "...", body = "...", icon = ..., category = "..." }, shown under
--   their category (default "Custom"). A category named in categories puts the macro in that section,
--   after its spells; any other category gets its own section after them.
--   name: up to 16 characters (WoW's macro name limit). body: the macro text, up to 255 characters; use \n
--   between lines. icon (optional): an icon file ID or texture path; without one, a body that starts with
--   "#showtooltip <spell>" shows that spell's icon.
--   Editing a body updates the WoW macro the next time the page opens. Removing an entry does not delete
--   the WoW macro: delete it in /macro.

-- Keyed by class file token (the second value of UnitClass), e.g. smb.classConfigs.WARLOCK.
smb.classConfigs = {}

-- Racials offered in every spell macro's Before Casting and After Casting menus, keyed by race file token
-- (the second value of UnitRace, e.g. NightElf, Scourge for Undead). Each is listed only once you've
-- learned it, so a class-specific racial only shows for that class. Add or remove names, then /reload.
